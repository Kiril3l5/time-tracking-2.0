# Project Setup Summary

## What We Fixed

1. **PNPM Workspace Configuration**
   - Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to properly define the monorepo structure
   - Configured workspace to include all packages in the `packages/` directory

2. **ESLint Configuration**
   - Updated `.eslintrc.js` to include proper plugins and rules
   - Added Jest plugin for testing
   - Configured rules to be more permissive during development
   - Fixed line ending issues

3. **Prettier Configuration**
   - Updated `.prettierrc.json` to include `endOfLine: "auto"` to handle line ending issues
   - Ensured consistent formatting across the codebase

4. **Testing Setup**
   - Installed Vitest and related testing libraries
   - Created `vitest.config.ts` with proper configuration
   - Added a test setup file in `packages/common/src/setupTests.ts`
   - Created example test files to demonstrate testing patterns

5. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Updated `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml` to use the new scripts
   - Re-enabled linting and testing in the CI pipeline
   - Improved the build and deployment process

6. **Package.json Scripts**
   - Added proper scripts for linting, testing, and formatting
   - Configured scripts to work with the monorepo structure
   - Fixed the test command to use Vitest

7. **Documentation**
   - Created `PROJECT_SETUP.md` to document the project structure and workflow
   - Created this summary to track the changes made

## Remaining Issues

1. **Linting Errors**
   - There are still some linting errors related to:
     - Unescaped entities in JSX
     - Using `any` type
     - Console statements
     - Unused variables
   - These can be addressed gradually as the project evolves

2. **Peer Dependencies**
   - There are some peer dependency warnings that should be addressed
   - These are mostly related to version mismatches between Vitest and its UI plugin

## Next Steps

1. **Address Remaining Linting Errors**
   - Gradually fix the remaining linting errors
   - Consider adding more specific ESLint rules as needed

2. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Add more comprehensive tests for the codebase
   - Consider setting up test coverage reporting

3. **Resolve Peer Dependencies**
   - Update dependencies to resolve version mismatches
   - Ensure all packages are using compatible versions

4. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Add more detailed documentation for specific features
   - Create contribution guidelines for the project
