### Integration with Automated Workflow

The preview deployment is a key step in the automated workflow. When you run `pnpm run workflow`:

1. The workflow will automatically:
   - Run quality checks
   - Build the application
   - Deploy to a preview channel
   - Create a PR with the preview URL

2. You can also run preview deployments independently:
   ```bash
   # Run just the preview deployment
   pnpm run preview
   
   # Create preview and PR
   pnpm run preview-and-pr
   
   # Quick preview with PR
   pnpm run preview-quick-and-pr
   ```

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Creating a Preview Deployment

When you want to test changes without deploying to production:

1. Make your changes to the code
2. Run `pnpm run preview`
3. Wait for the build and deployment to complete (~2-5 minutes)
4. Use the URLs shown in the output to access your preview

The preview script will:
- **Verify dependencies** - Checks if all required packages are properly installed
- **Verify Firebase authentication** - Checks if you're properly logged in
- **Verify Git configuration** - Ensures Git is properly setup and identifies your branch
- **Check if you're approaching the Firebase channel limit** (10 per site)
- **Automatically clean up old previews** if necessary
- **Build all packages** (common, admin, hours)
- **Analyze bundle sizes** - Checks for significant increases in bundle size
- **Run dependency audit** - Uses `pnpm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Detect dead code** - Finds unused code, imports, and CSS
- **Check documentation quality** - Identifies duplicate content and validates key documentation
- **Run ESLint checks** - Validates code quality including import syntax consistency
- **Validate GitHub workflow files** - Checks workflow configurations against package.json scripts
- **Deploy to a new unique preview channel** with your git branch name
- **Show you the working preview URLs**

Example output:
```

```

#### Post-PR Workflow

After your PR is created, reviewed, and merged to the main branch:

1. The workflow provides clear guidance on next steps:
   - Switch to the main branch with `git checkout main`
   - Pull the latest changes with `git pull origin main`
   - Deploy to production with `node scripts/deploy.js "Your deployment message"`
   
2. This ensures your changes are properly deployed to production after merging, maintaining a consistent workflow from development to production deployment.

Example workflow sequence:
```bash
# After your PR is merged on GitHub
git checkout main
git pull origin main
node scripts/deploy.js "Deploy feature XYZ"
```

#### Enhanced Error Handling

The workflow now provides detailed error information when issues occur:

```
=== ERROR SUMMARY ===
Found 2 error(s) during workflow execution:

== Errors in Dependency Management ==
- Missing required packages: glob, firebase
  Suggestion: Run "pnpm install" to install all dependencies.

== Errors in Authentication ==
- Firebase authentication failed: No Firebase users signed in
  Suggestion: Try running "firebase login" to authenticate with Firebase.

==========================
```

This improved error handling:
- Groups errors by workflow step
- Provides detailed error messages
- Offers actionable suggestions to fix issues
- Shows error summaries at the end of the workflow

#### Viewing and Managing Previews

1. Run `pnpm run channels` or `pnpm run channels:dashboard` to see all your active previews in a nice dashboard
   - The dashboard shows previews grouped by branch name
   - It displays URLs, creation dates, and expiration information
   - Color-coded indicators show channel age and status at a glance
   - If you don't see your channels in the dashboard, try running `firebase hosting:channel:list` directly in the terminal

2. Run `pnpm run channels:list` to see all preview channels in JSON format
   - This shows all technical details of each channel including creation dates and URLs
   - Useful for programmatic access or if you need to examine channel metadata

3. Run `pnpm run channels:cleanup` to remove old previews you don't need anymore
   - This is interactive - you choose which previews to delete
   
4. Run `pnpm run channels:cleanup:auto` to automatically clean up old channels
   - This will sort channels by creation date and remove all but the most recent ones
   - You'll still be asked to confirm before deletion
   - Useful when you've hit the channel limit (Firebase allows max 10 channels per site)

5. For additional channel operations, run `pnpm run channels:help` to see all available commands and options

> **Note:** The legacy commands `preview:dashboard`, `preview:list`, `preview:cleanup`, and `preview:cleanup:auto` are still available for backward compatibility but will be deprecated in the future in favor of the new `channels` commands.

### Bundle Size Analysis

The preview workflow now includes automatic bundle size analysis to prevent performance regressions. This feature:

1. **Tracks bundle sizes over time** - Records the size of each JS and CSS file
2. **Detects significant increases** - Warns when bundles grow too large
3. **Generates a visual report** - Creates an HTML report of bundle sizes

#### Understanding the Bundle Analysis Report

After running `pnpm run preview`, a bundle analysis report will be generated at `./bundle-report.html`. This report shows:

- Total size of each package (common, admin, hours)
- Size of individual files within each package
- Percentage change from the previous deployment
- Warnings or errors for significant increases

#### Bundle Analysis Options

You can customize the bundle analysis with these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skip-bundle-analysis` | Skip bundle size analysis |
| `--bundle-baseline <path>` | Use a specific baseline file for comparison |

For example:
```bash
# Skip bundle analysis
pnpm run preview --skip-bundle-analysis

# Use a specific baseline for comparison
pnpm run preview --bundle-baseline ./baselines/production-bundle-sizes.json
```

### Workflow Performance Metrics

The preview workflow now includes basic performance tracking capabilities, though the dedicated `workflow-metrics.js` module mentioned in previous documentation is still in development. Current metrics capabilities include:

- **Basic timing measurements** for key workflow stages
- **Execution time reporting** at the end of the workflow
- **Simple performance insights** for workflow bottlenecks

Future enhancements to the metrics system will include:
- More detailed timing metrics for each workflow stage and operation
- Performance trend analysis to identify slowdowns over time
- Automatic metrics collection for every preview workflow run
- Reporting and visualization of performance data
- CI/CD integration for tracking metrics in automated workflows
- Resource usage monitoring for memory and CPU intensive operations

**Current metrics collected:**
- Total workflow execution time
- Time spent in key workflow stages
- Simple performance insights where available

> Note: The full metrics tracking system described in the documentation is partially implemented. Some options like `--metrics-baseline` may not be fully functional yet.

### Documentation Freshness Check

Basic documentation quality and freshness checks have been implemented in the `doc-quality.js` module. A more comprehensive `doc-freshness.js` module is planned with these features:

- **Link validation** to detect broken documentation references
- **Timestamp analysis** to identify outdated documentation
- **Cross-reference checking** between code and documentation
- **Content staleness detection** based on repository changes
- **Documentation coverage analysis** for new features
- **Automated reporting** of documentation health metrics

Currently, the document quality checker provides basic documentation validation, duplication detection, and coverage reporting.

#### Understanding Documentation Freshness Report

When the full system is implemented, you'll see more comprehensive reports. Currently, the documentation quality report provides basic freshness information:

```
=== Documentation Quality Report ===
Documentation coverage: 92%
Documentation files analyzed: 24
Issues found: 3
  - 2 potential duplicate sections
  - 1 missing required documentation file

Documentation passed minimum quality threshold: Yes
```

#### Documentation Check Options

You can customize the documentation checks with these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skip-doc-quality` | Skip documentation quality and freshness checks |
| `--doc-quality-threshold <percentage>` | Set minimum documentation quality threshold |

For example:
```bash
# Skip documentation quality checks
pnpm run preview --skip-doc-quality
```

### Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

The preview workflow now includes dependency vulnerability scanning to prevent security risks from reaching production. This feature:

1. **Scans all dependencies** - Checks for known vulnerabilities in npm packages
2. **Creates a detailed report** - Generates an HTML report with vulnerability details
3. **Blocks deployment on critical issues** - Prevents deployment if critical vulnerabilities are found
4. **Maintains security standards** - Helps ensure compliance with security requirements

#### Understanding the Vulnerability Report

After running `pnpm run preview`, a vulnerability scan report will be generated at `./vulnerability-report.html`. This report shows:

- Summary of vulnerabilities by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Detailed listing of each detected vulnerability
- Path information showing which package is introducing the vulnerability
- Fix information when available (e.g., which version resolves the issue)
- Links to advisory details for each vulnerability

#### Dependency Scanning Options

You can customize the vulnerability scanning with these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skip-dependency-scan` | Skip dependency vulnerability scanning |
| `--vulnerability-threshold <level>` | Choose severity threshold (critical, high, medium, low) |

For example:
```bash
# Skip vulnerability scanning
pnpm run preview --skip-dependency-scan

# Only fail on high or critical vulnerabilities 
pnpm run preview --vulnerability-threshold high

# Fail on any vulnerability
pnpm run preview --vulnerability-threshold low
```

The default behavior is to only fail the workflow for critical vulnerabilities, but report all detected issues.

### Dead Code Detection

The preview workflow now includes dead code detection to help reduce bundle size. This feature:

1. **Identifies unused exports, components, and functions**
2. **Detects unused dependencies in package.json**
3. **Finds unused CSS classes and styles**
4. **Estimates potential bundle size reduction**
5. **Generates a visual HTML report with recommendations**

#### Dead Code Detection Options

You can customize the dead code detection with these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skip-dead-code-detection` | Skip dead code detection |

For example:
```bash
# Skip dead code detection
pnpm run preview --skip-dead-code-detection
```

### Documentation Quality Check

The preview workflow now includes documentation quality checks to maintain consistent and complete documentation. This feature:

1. **Identifies potential duplicate content** across Markdown files
2. **Validates that key features have documentation**
3. **Generates a documentation index** for easier navigation
4. **Analyzes documentation health metrics** like coverage and freshness
5. **Creates an HTML report** with documentation insights and recommendations

#### Documentation Quality Options

You can customize the documentation quality checks with these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skip-doc-quality` | Skip documentation quality checks |

For example:
```bash
# Skip documentation quality checks
pnpm run preview --skip-doc-quality
```

### Module Syntax Consistency

The preview workflow now checks for consistent ES Module syntax to prevent build failures. This feature:

1. **Identifies inconsistent module syntax** across the codebase
2. **Automatically converts CommonJS requires to ES imports** when possible
3. **Fixes issues with __dirname and __filename in ES Modules**
4. **Ensures consistent import/export patterns**
5. **Prevents common build errors** related to module resolution

### Recent Improvements

The workflow system has recently received several major improvements:

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

The new `error-handler.js` module provides centralized error handling, with features like:

- **Standardized error classes** for different error types (Authentication, QualityCheck, Build, Deployment, etc.)
- **Error aggregation** across multiple workflow steps
- **Human-readable error summaries** with clear formatting
- **Recovery suggestions** for common errors
- **Graceful workflow termination** with detailed error reports
- **Global error handlers** for uncaught exceptions

This ensures that when errors occur, users get clear, actionable information about what went wrong and how to fix it, rather than cryptic error messages.

**Key classes include:**
- `WorkflowError` - Base class for all workflow errors
- `AuthenticationError` - For authentication issues
- `QualityCheckError` - For linting, testing, or other quality check failures
- `BuildError` - For build process failures
- `DeploymentError` - For deployment issues
- `DependencyError` - For missing or incompatible dependencies

**Error handling flow:**
1. Errors are caught and converted to standard WorkflowError types
2. Contextual information is added (workflow step, cause, etc.)
3. Errors are aggregated in the central errorTracker
4. At workflow end, a comprehensive error summary is displayed
5. Each error includes specific recovery suggestions

#### 2. Workflow Metrics Tracking

The workflow now includes basic performance tracking capabilities, though the dedicated `workflow-metrics.js` module mentioned in previous documentation is still in development. Current metrics capabilities include:

- **Basic timing measurements** for key workflow stages
- **Execution time reporting** at the end of the workflow
- **Simple performance insights** for workflow bottlenecks

Future enhancements to the metrics system will include:
- More detailed timing metrics for each workflow stage and operation
- Performance trend analysis to identify slowdowns over time
- Automatic metrics collection for every preview workflow run
- Reporting and visualization of performance data
- CI/CD integration for tracking metrics in automated workflows

### Preview Workflow Architecture

The preview workflow follows this enhanced sequence:

1. **Initialization**
   - Parse command line arguments
   - Set up logging and error handling
   - Initialize progress tracker
   - Start workflow metrics collection

2. **Dependency Verification** (NEW)
   - Check required packages
   - Verify external commands
   - Attempt auto-install if configured
   - Track dependency verification time

3. **Authentication**
   - Verify Firebase authentication
   - Check Git configuration
   - Determine required permissions
   - Track authentication time metrics

4. **Quality Checks**
   - Run linting and TypeScript checks
   - Check for module syntax consistency
   - Validate environment configuration
   - Track individual check performance

5. **Build Process**
   - Build all packages
   - Analyze bundle size
   - Check for vulnerabilities
   - Track build performance metrics

6. **Deployment**
   - Create or reuse Firebase preview channel
   - Deploy built files
   - Extract preview URLs
   - Track deployment time metrics

7. **Post-Deployment**
   - Add PR comments if applicable
   - Clean up temporary files
   - Generate final report with error summary
   - Save and display workflow performance metrics

### Error Handling Flow

When errors occur in the workflow, they are processed as follows:

1. The error is caught and converted to a standardized `WorkflowError` type
2. Context information is added (workflow step, cause, etc.)
3. The error is logged with proper formatting
4. A recovery suggestion is generated based on the error type
5. The error is added to the central `errorTracker`
6. The workflow may continue or terminate gracefully depending on error severity
7. At the end of the workflow, an error summary is shown if errors occurred

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the workflow system include:

1. **Performance optimization** - Reduce build and deployment times
2. **Integration with CI/CD platforms** - Better GitHub Actions integration
3. **Enhanced analytics** - Track deployment metrics over time
4. **Multi-environment support** - Preview against different backend environments
5. **Enhanced permission management** - Role-based access controls for previews

## 🚀 Integration With External Systems

### GitHub Integration

The preview system integrates with GitHub in the following ways:

1. **PR Comments** - Automatically adds comments to PRs with preview URLs
2. **Branch Detection** - Extracts branch and PR information for labeling
3. **CI Support** - Functions correctly in GitHub Actions workflows

### Firebase Integration

The preview system integrates with Firebase hosting in the following ways:

1. **Channel Management** - Creates and manages preview channels
2. **Authentication** - Verifies Firebase CLI authentication status
3. **Deployment** - Handles the deployment process to Firebase hosting
4. **Cleanup** - Manages the lifecycle of preview channels

## 🔍 Advanced Configuration

## 🛠️ Recent Fixes

We've recently made several important improvements to the preview workflow:

### 1. Fixed Step Numbering Issue

The workflow was previously showing incorrect step numbers (like "Step 9/4"). This has been fixed by:

- Implementing a more accurate step counting mechanism that properly tracks the total number of steps
- Ensuring the displayed step numbers match the actual total number of steps
- Correctly handling skipped steps in the total count

### 2. Fixed Module Syntax Check Issues

The module syntax check was occasionally getting stuck, particularly on Windows systems. This has been fixed by:

- Improving directory validation before scanning
- Adding proper error handling for file and directory access
- Enhancing Windows path compatibility
- Adding validation to ensure directories exist before attempting to scan them
- Implementing better handling of glob patterns
- Making the recursive directory scanning more robust

### 3. Bundle Size Threshold Increase

The bundle size threshold has been increased from 250KB to 1MB to accommodate the actual size of the application.

### 4. Package Manager Consistency

Updated all scripts to consistently use `pnpm` instead of mixing package managers:
- Replace hardcoded `npm run` commands with `pnpm run`
- Add validation to warn when multiple package managers are detected
- Fix GitHub workflow to use `pnpm` consistently

### 5. Fixed Dependency Scanner Issues

The dependency vulnerability scanner was previously failing with "Cannot convert undefined or null to object" errors. These improvements have been made:

- Added defensive programming checks to handle null or undefined vulnerability data
- Implemented proper error handling in the `scanDependencies` function
- Added a robust try/catch block to prevent the workflow from failing when scanning encounters issues
- Ensured valid reports are always generated even when the vulnerability scan has issues
- Added logging to provide better visibility into the scanning process
- Modified the `generateIssueList` function to handle invalid inputs gracefully

### 6. Fixed Documentation Quality Checker

The documentation quality checker had several ESLint warnings related to unused variables. These improvements have been made:

- Renamed unused variables to have underscore prefixes (e.g., `fileName` to `_fileName`) to comply with ESLint rules
- Fixed variable references in multiple functions including `analyzeDocumentation` and `checkDocQuality`
- Added proper imports to replace global references
- Updated the code to ensure consistent module syntax
- Fixed references to default patterns and configuration constants
- Improved error handling in documentation scanning functions

### 7. Added Fallback Report Generation

To ensure the consolidated dashboard always generates even when individual reports fail:

- Added a test report generator that creates a minimal valid JSON report when needed
- Enhanced error handling in the report collection process
- Added debugging to track file existence in the temp directory
- Improved logging to provide better visibility into the report generation process
- Ensured at least one valid JSON report is always available for dashboard generation

## 🚧 Known Issues

While we've made significant improvements to the preview workflow, there are still a few known issues to be aware of:

### 1. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning Warnings

The dependency vulnerability scanner may show warnings in the output like "Cannot convert undefined or null to object". These warnings occur when:

- The npm registry is temporarily unavailable
- The vulnerability database hasn't been updated
- There are network connectivity issues

These warnings won't stop the workflow from completing, but they may result in incomplete vulnerability information in the final dashboard. We've added defensive code to ensure the workflow continues even with these issues.

### 2. TypeScript Version Warning

You may see TypeScript version compatibility warnings when running ESLint:

```
WARNING: You are currently running a version of TypeScript which is not officially supported by @typescript-eslint/typescript-estree.
```

This warning appears because we're using a newer version of TypeScript than what is officially supported by the ESLint TypeScript parser. The linting still works correctly despite this warning.

### 3. Bundle Size Analysis Limitation

The bundle size analysis may not detect all code splitting chunks correctly, which can lead to warnings about bundle size increases when there haven't been actual increases. This is a limitation of the current bundle analyzer implementation.

### 4. Report Dashboard Generation

Occasionally, the consolidated report dashboard might not include all reports if individual checks fail. We've implemented a fallback mechanism that creates a minimal test report to ensure the dashboard is always generated, but some sections may show placeholder data instead of actual results.

### 5. Double Build Issue (Fixed)

Previously, the preview deployment would build the application twice - once during the build step and again during deployment. We've fixed this issue by adding a `skipBuild` parameter to the `deployToPreviewChannel` function, which prevents the second build when the application has already been built.

### Workarounds

If you encounter any of these issues, try these workarounds:

1. For dependency scanning issues: Run the preview with `--skip-dependency-scan` to bypass the dependency vulnerability check.
2. For report generation issues: Use the `--keep-individual-reports` flag to preserve individual JSON reports for inspection.
3. For bundle analysis issues: Use the `--skip-bundle-analysis` flag if you're getting false positives about bundle size increases.
4. For TypeScript version warnings: These can be safely ignored as they don't affect functionality.
