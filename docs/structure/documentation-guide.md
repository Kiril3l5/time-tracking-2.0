## Overview

This guide establishes standards for organizing documentation within the Time Tracking System project. Following these guidelines will help maintain a clean, consistent, and easily navigable documentation structure.

## Documentation Structure

The project documentation is organized into the following directories:

```
docs/
├── env/             # Environment setup and configuration
├── main_readme/     # Comprehensive guides for major system components
├── network/         # Network requirements and connectivity documentation
├── patterns/        # Design patterns and implementation examples
├── security/        # Security rules and implementation strategies
├── structure/       # Project structure and organization guides
├── testing/         # Testing strategies and methodologies
└── workflow/        # Development, deployment, and operational workflows
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### 1. File Naming

- Use kebab-case for all documentation files: `example-guide.md`
- Names should be descriptive but concise
- Avoid version numbers in filenames unless absolutely necessary

### 2. Content Structure

Each documentation file should follow this structure:

- **Title**: Clear title at the top using H1 (`# Title`)
- **Overview**: Brief introduction explaining the purpose of the document
- **Main Content**: Organized with H2 (`## Section`) and H3 (`### Subsection`) headings
- **Examples**: Include practical code examples where applicable
- **Related Documentation**: Link to related guides at the end

### 3. Cross-Referencing

- Use relative paths when linking between documentation files
- Example: `[Security Rules](../security/firestore-rules.md)`
- Always validate links when moving or renaming files

### 4. Code Examples

- Use syntax highlighting by specifying the language after backticks:
  ```typescript
  function example(): string {
    return "Hello World";
  }
  ```
- Keep code examples concise and focused
- Add comments to complex code examples

## Documentation Maintenance

### Periodic Review Process

1. **Quarterly Review**: All documentation should be reviewed quarterly
2. **Update Check**: Verify technical accuracy and update outdated information
3. **Consolidation**: Identify and merge redundant documentation
4. **Cleanup**: Run the cleanup script (`scripts/cleanup.sh`) to maintain cleanliness

### Before Adding New Documentation

1. Check if the topic is already covered in existing documentation
2. Determine the appropriate directory for the new content
3. Follow the established naming and structure conventions
4. Update the main README.md if the document should be linked there

## Documentation Types

### Implementation Guides

- Focus on "how" something is implemented
- Include code examples and architectural decisions
- Place in appropriate subdirectory (e.g., security, patterns)

### Conceptual Guides

- Focus on explaining "what" and "why"
- Provide context and high-level understanding
- Usually placed in main_readme/ directory

### Reference Documentation

- Provided for lookup purposes
- Typically organized alphabetically or by component
- Examples include API references or component libraries

## Avoiding Documentation Bloat

- **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept should be documented in only one place
- **Linking Over Duplication**: Link to existing documentation rather than duplicating
- **Archiving**: Move obsolete documentation to an archive directory instead of deleting
- **Versioning**: Only maintain current version in main directories; use repository history for older versions
