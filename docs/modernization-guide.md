## Current Status

The project has been significantly modernized with:
- Up-to-date dependencies and configurations
- Modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Improved TypeScript usage with strict typing
- Better error handling with the enhanced ErrorBoundary
- Working build system (for all packages)
- Functional testing framework with proper TypeScript integration
- Comprehensive linting with automated fixes
- Reliable CI/CD pipeline with proper cleanup steps
- Basic components working
- Clean TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Build fix script for package resolution issues
- Documented TypeScript and linting guidelines for AI-assisted development
- Reliable test environment with JSX runtime support
- Consistent ES Module syntax across all JavaScript files
- Automated tools for fixing module syntax errors

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Update remaining class components to function components
- [ ] Ensure all components follow best practices

## Automation Scripts

Several scripts have been created to assist with the modernization process:

```bash
# Fix dependencies and conflicts
pnpm run modernize:deps

# Fix Jest-DOM issues
pnpm run modernize:jest-dom

# Analyze components for modernization
pnpm run modernize:components

# Run the test suite
pnpm test

# Fix build issues with proper package resolution
pnpm run fix:build

# Fix TypeScript issues
pnpm run edit:fix-typescript

# Fix linting issues
pnpm run lint:fix
```

## Component Modernization Report

Running `pnpm run modernize:components` generated a report indicating:
- Only 1 class component remains: `ErrorBoundary.tsx` (which must remain a class component due to React limitations)
- Added new utility functions (`withErrorBoundary` and `useErrorHandler`) to make error handling more functional

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Jest-DOM Compatibility

**Problem**: Issues with Jest-DOM when running tests
**Solution**: Using `@testing-library/jest-dom` version 6.1.4 and ensuring proper setup

### React Query Type Issues

**Problem**: Type errors with React Query hooks
**Solution**: Added proper types and fixed implementations

### Module Resolution Issues

**Problem**: ESM/CJS compatibility issues
**Solution**: Updated import/export syntax and configuration

### JavaScript Module Syntax Issues

**Problem**: Scripts failing with `require is not defined in ES module scope` error
**Solution**: All JavaScript files must use ES Module syntax because of `"type": "module"` in package.json

The project uses ES Modules exclusively. Never use CommonJS `require()` in `.js` files:

```javascript
// ❌ INCORRECT: This will cause runtime errors
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

// ✅ CORRECT: Use ES Module imports
import { execSync } from 'child_process';
```

Refer to `docs/javascript-module-guide.md` for detailed guidance.

### JSX in Tests Issues

**Problem**: JSX not recognized in test files
**Solution**: Added JSX handling in Vitest configuration

### TailwindCSS v4 Issues

**Problem**: TailwindCSS v4 requires @tailwindcss/postcss instead of direct usage
**Solution**: Updated PostCSS configuration to use the proper plugin

### React JSX Runtime Missing

**Problem**: Tests failing with error: "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'node_modules/react/jsx-runtime.js'"
**Solution**: Added a `fix:test-deps` script that:
1. Detects missing JSX runtime files
2. Reinstalls React if needed
3. Creates a fallback JSX runtime from jsx-dev-runtime.js if available
4. Updates Vitest configuration to properly resolve React JSX runtime

To fix this issue:
```bash
# Run the fix script directly
pnpm run fix:test-deps

# Alternatively, the test commands now automatically run this fix
pnpm test
```

### Immer/Zustand Build Issues

**Problem**: Vite build fails with immer resolution errors
**Solution**: Created a fix:build script that reinstalls dependencies and optimizes Vite configuration

### TypeScript Linting With Test Files

**Problem**: ESLint was failing with TypeScript errors for test files
**Solution**: Updated tsconfig.json to include test files and added .eslintignore for generated files

### Cleanup Script in CI

**Problem**: Cleanup script was missing in CI environments
**Solution**: Added proper cleanup.js script with platform detection and CI environment handling

## Using the Build Fix Script

We created a dedicated script to fix module resolution issues that can occur with modern ESM packages like immer and zustand:

1. Run the script to clean dependencies and reinstall them properly:
   ```bash
   pnpm run fix:build
   ```

2. This script will:
   - Clean node_modules
   - Clear pnpm cache
   - Reinstall dependencies with correct versions
   - Build packages in the correct order

3. If you encounter any specific build issues with a package, you can build them individually:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build:common
   pnpm run build:admin
   pnpm run build:hours
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the Vite build issues:
   - Run the fix:build script to resolve immer and zustand package compatibility issues
   - Verify that all packages build correctly

2. Complete the build and deployment setup:
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline works properly
   - Verify production deployments work

3. Run tests with `pnpm test` to verify changes

## TypeScript and Linting Guidelines

We've created comprehensive TypeScript and linting guidelines for the project. See `docs/typescript-linting-guide.md` for detailed information about:

- TypeScript best practices for AI-generated code
- ESLint rules and configurations
- Testing guidelines with proper TypeScript integration
- Code examples of good and bad practices
- CI/CD integration details

## JavaScript Module Guidelines

For detailed guidance on using JavaScript modules in this project, see `docs/javascript-module-guide.md`. This guide covers:

- ES Module vs CommonJS syntax
- How to properly import modules in ES Module files
- Getting `__dirname` and `__filename` in ES modules
- Common errors and their solutions  
- Converting between module formats
- Testing ES Module scripts

This guide is essential to avoid errors like `require is not defined in ES module scope` which can occur because this project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json.
