## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive plan to modernize the Time Tracking System codebase. We aim to:

1. Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions
2. Fix TypeScript typing issues
3. Improve testing infrastructure
4. Apply current React best practices
5. Ensure CI/CD pipeline reliability

## Current Issues

Based on our analysis, the following issues need to be addressed:

1. **Deprecated Dependencies:** Many packages are using outdated versions
2. **TypeScript Errors:** Multiple type definition issues, especially with React Query
3. **Test Configuration:** Testing setup is incomplete and failing
4. **Linting Issues:** Inconsistently applied linting rules
5. **Build Failures:** Configuration issues prevent successful builds

## Modernization Steps

### Step 1: Update Dependencies

We'll update key dependencies to their latest versions:

**React Query:**
```
@tanstack/react-query v4.29.5 → v5.28.2
```

**React Router:**
```
react-router-dom (missing) → v6.22.3
```

**Testing Libraries:**
```
vitest v0.33.0 → v1.6.1
@testing-library/jest-dom v6.1.4 → v6.6.3
@testing-library/react v16.2.0 → v14.3.1
```

**Other Dependencies:**
```
react-hook-form (missing) → v7.51.1
@hookform/resolvers (missing) → v3.3.4
zod (missing) → v3.22.4
```

### Step 2: Fix TypeScript Configuration

We'll update the TypeScript configuration to leverage modern language features:

1. Update `tsconfig.json` with modern settings
2. Fix path aliases for better imports
3. Update React Query type usage
4. Create comprehensive type declarations

### Step 3: Improve Test Setup

Testing improvements include:

1. Configure Vitest properly with Jest DOM
2. Create proper test setup files
3. Set up effective mocks for Firebase
4. Establish consistent test patterns

### Step 4: Apply Modern React Patterns

We'll modernize React code with:

1. Modern React Query usage (v5 patterns)
2. Custom hooks for logic separation
3. Proper context usage
4. Type-safe component props

### Step 5: Fix Build System

Build system improvements:

1. Update Vite configurations
2. Fix module resolution
3. Update import/export patterns
4. Configure proper environment variables

## Implementation Process

To implement these changes with minimal disruption, we'll follow this process:

1. **Run Modernization Script:** Execute `pnpm run modernize` to automate dependency updates
2. **Fix Query Types:** Run `pnpm run fix:query-types` to update React Query usage
3. **Manual Fixes:** Address remaining TypeScript and linting issues
4. **Verify:** Test the entire application locally
5. **CI/CD:** Update GitHub Actions workflow for proper testing

## Verification Checklist

After implementing changes, verify:

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Tests run successfully
- [ ] Application builds correctly
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes
- [ ] Core functionality works in development

## Fallback Plan

If issues arise, we have these fallback options:

1. Temporarily revert to previous dependency versions where necessary
2. Use type assertions for challenging TypeScript issues
3. Create additional type declaration files as needed

## Timeline

Expected timeline for completion:

- **Day 1:** Run automatic scripts and fix major dependency issues
- **Day 2:** Fix remaining TypeScript and test issues
- **Day 3:** Test and verify all functionality
- **Day 4:** Update documentation and finalize
