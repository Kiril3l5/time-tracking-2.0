# Project Modernization Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Updated all packages to their latest versions
   - Switched to ESM modules (added `"type": "module"` to package.json)
   - Fixed peer dependency issues where possible

2. **Modernized Configuration Files**
   - Updated TypeScript configuration
   - Converted PostCSS and Tailwind configs to ESM
   - Created proper ESLint configuration compatible with v9

3. **Improved Testing Setup**
   - Fixed Vitest configuration
   - Created a modern test setup file
   - Implemented basic test functionality
   - Added proper Firebase mocks
   - Created comprehensive Button component test
   - Added TypeScript declarations for testing-library and jest-dom
   - Set up proper test environment with jsdom

4. **Fixed React Query Types**
   - Updated React Query imports to follow v5 patterns
   - Created type declarations for compatibility
   - Fixed common type issues

5. **Updated Project Files**
   - Organized the project structure
   - Added proper type declarations for various file types
   - Implemented modern ESLint rules

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Fix DOM Testing**
   - Resolve issues with @testing-library/jest-dom
   - Update component tests to use modern patterns
   - Ensure proper DOM assertions work in tests

2. **Finish Type Fixes**
   - Address remaining TypeScript errors
   - Fix implicit 'any' types
   - Update React component props types

3. **Update Components**
   - Implement modern React patterns
   - Remove deprecated lifecycle methods
   - Use function components where possible

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Update GitHub Actions workflow
   - Fix deployment scripts
   - Ensure proper test coverage

5. **Documentation**
   - Update README with new setup instructions
   - Document modernization process
   - Create developer guidelines

## Next Steps

To continue the modernization process:

1. Run `pnpm run fix:all` to address all issues in one go
2. Run `pnpm run fix:query-types` to address React Query issues
3. Fix the remaining TypeScript errors one by one
4. Update all tests to use the Button.test.tsx as a reference implementation
5. Verify the build process
6. Test deployment to ensure everything works correctly

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress in modernizing the codebase. The project now uses current industry best practices and up-to-date dependencies. The remaining issues are primarily related to specific component implementations and test assertions that need updating to match the modern structure.
