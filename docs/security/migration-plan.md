# Security Documentation Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for consolidating duplicate security documentation to maintain a single source of truth. We've identified redundancy between `docs/security/implementation.md` and `docs/main_readme/security-implementation-guide.md`.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Documentation Assessment

**Current State:**
- `docs/security/implementation.md`: Focused, concise security implementation details (188 lines)
- `docs/main_readme/security-implementation-guide.md`: Comprehensive security guide (709 lines)

**Recommendation:**
Retain the more comprehensive document in `docs/main_readme/` and update links in other documents.

### 2. Content Consolidation

Any unique information from `docs/security/implementation.md` should be merged into the comprehensive guide.

Key sections to verify before deletion:
- [x] Data Validation implementation
- [x] Access Auditing with Metadata
- [x] Field-Level Security for Managers
- [x] Defense in Depth approach
- [x] Testing Security Rules implementation

### 3. Link Updates

The following files need to be updated to point to the comprehensive guide:

- [x] `README.md`
- [x] Any other documents linking to `docs/security/implementation.md`

Replace:
```markdown
[Security Implementation](./docs/security/implementation.md)
```

With:
```markdown
[Security Implementation](./docs/main_readme/security-implementation-guide.md)
```

### 4. Cleanup

After consolidation:
- [x] Delete `docs/security/implementation.md`
- [x] Run `scripts/cleanup.sh` to perform cleanup
- [x] Verify all links are working correctly

### 5. Future Documentation

For future security documentation:
- Place high-level security concepts and architecture in `docs/security/`
- Keep detailed implementation guides in `docs/main_readme/`
- Use cross-references to maintain connections between documents
