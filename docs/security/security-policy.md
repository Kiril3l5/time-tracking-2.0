# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policy for the Time Tracking 2.0 project. It covers supported versions, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security measures implemented across the codebase.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0   | :x:                |

## Vulnerability Reporting

We take the security of our application seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Security Measures

This project implements the following security measures:

### Input Validation and Sanitization

* All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing
* HTML content is properly escaped to prevent XSS attacks
* File paths are validated and sanitized before use
* Command arguments are properly escaped to prevent command injection

### Authentication and Authorization

* JWT tokens are used for authentication
* Role-based access control is implemented
* Session management follows security best practices
* Password hashing uses strong algorithms

### Dependency Management

* Dependencies are regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities
* Security audits are performed as part of the CI/CD pipeline
* Known vulnerable dependencies are automatically blocked

### Code Quality and Security

* Static code analysis is performed using CodeQL
* Security annotations are used to document security measures
* Code reviews include security considerations
* Automated security testing is part of the CI/CD pipeline

### Data Protection

* Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
* Secure communication channels are used
* Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration
* No hardcoded credentials in the codebase

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. All dependencies are up-to-date
2. No security vulnerabilities are reported by `pnpm audit`
3. CodeQL analysis passes without critical or high severity issues
4. All security annotations are properly implemented
5. No sensitive data is exposed in logs or error messages
6. All environment variables are properly configured
7. All security headers are properly set
8. All authentication mechanisms are properly implemented
