# Network Connectivity Requirements

## Overview

The Time Tracking System requires an active internet connection for all operations that involve data creation, modification, or retrieval. This document explains the network requirements and how the application handles offline states.

## Connectivity Requirements

1. **Internet Connection Required**: 
   - All data operations (create, read, update, delete) require an active internet connection
   - Authentication and authorization processes require connectivity
   - Time entry submissions and approvals need real-time connectivity

2. **No Offline Mode**:
   - The application does not support offline operation or data caching
   - Changes cannot be saved locally when offline
   - Data synchronization is not implemented to reduce complexity and potential conflicts

## User Experience

When a user loses internet connectivity:

1. A notification banner appears informing the user that they are offline
2. Form submission buttons remain active but will show error messages if clicked
3. Real-time data updates will pause until connectivity is restored
4. When connectivity is restored, the notification banner automatically disappears

## Implementation Details

The application uses the browser's built-in `navigator.onLine` property and the `online`/`offline` events to detect network status changes:

```tsx
// NetworkStatus component
export const NetworkStatus: React.FC = () => {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(navigator.onLine);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleOnline = () => setIsOnline(true);
    const handleOffline = () => setIsOnline(false);

    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  if (isOnline) return null;

  return (
    <div className="network-status-banner">
      You are currently offline. An internet connection is required to save changes.
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Stable Connection**: Use a stable internet connection when working with the application
2. **Save Frequently**: Save work in progress frequently to prevent data loss
3. **Check Status**: Pay attention to the offline notification banner if it appears
4. **Prepare Content**: For longer entries, consider drafting content in a text editor before pasting into the application

## Future Considerations

While offline support is not implemented currently to maintain simplicity, future versions may consider:

1. Read-only offline access to recently viewed data
2. Basic form draft saving in browser storage
3. Conflict resolution for overlapping changes

These features would only be implemented after thorough evaluation of the complexity and potential user confusion they might introduce.
