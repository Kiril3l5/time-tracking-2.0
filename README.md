# Time Tracking System 2.0

A modern, TypeScript-based time tracking application with two completely separate sites:
- **/hours**: End-user facing application for time entry and tracking
- **/admin**: Administration portal for managers and administrators

Both sites are hosted on Firebase and share a common Firebase database for time entries, approvals, and user management.

## Architecture

This project implements a monorepo structure with:

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common/     # Shared code between sites
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hours/      # End-user time tracking site
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ admin/      # Admin management site
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ functions/      # Firebase Cloud Functions
```

Key technologies:
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework**: React 18
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Package Manager**: PNPM with workspaces

## ðŸ§  Working with AI Tools

When using AI tools like Claude to assist with this project, follow these best practices:

### Effective AI Prompting

1. **Provide Context**: Point the AI to relevant documentation files, especially:
   - [Preview Deployment Guide](./docs/workflow/preview-deployment-guide.md)
   - [Firebase Deployment Workflow](./docs/workflow/firebase-deployment-workflow.md)
   - [Automated Workflow Guide](./docs/workflow/automated-workflow-guide.md)

2. **Be Specific**: Request specific tasks rather than general improvements.
   - Good: "Help me fix the TypeScript error in `packages/common/src/firebase/hooks/query-hooks.ts`"
   - Avoid: "Fix all the errors in the project"

3. **One Task at a Time**: Focus on completing one task before moving to the next.

4. **Include Error Messages**: When troubleshooting, always include the complete error message.

### What To Do

- **Use the automated workflow**: Start development with `pnpm run workflow` or `pnpm run dev`
- **Create preview deployments**: Use `pnpm run preview` to test changes
- **Use the modular script system**: Leverage our enhanced tooling for faster development
- **Follow the post-PR workflow**: After a PR is merged, deploy to production with `node scripts/deploy.js "Your message"`
- **Use the logger** instead of direct console statements

### What To Avoid

- **Don't mix package managers**: Use pnpm exclusively for this project
- **Don't skip the post-PR deployment step**: Always deploy to production after merging
- **Don't ignore TypeScript errors**: Fix them with `pnpm run fix:typescript:enhanced`
- **Don't use direct console.log statements**: Use the logger module instead
- **Don't rebuild unnecessarily**: The skipBuild option is now available to prevent double builds

### Documentation Maintenance

All documentation follows a structured approach defined in our [Documentation Organization Guide](./docs/structure/documentation-guide.md):

1. **For New Documentation**:
   - Place files in the appropriate category folder in `/docs/`
   - Use kebab-case naming: `example-guide.md`
   - Add the file to the [documentation index](./docs/documentation-index.md)
   - Link to it from related documentation

2. **For Updating Documentation**:
   - Make documentation changes alongside code changes
   - Update the "Last Modified" date
   - Update the documentation index if file size or summary changed
   - Include documentation updates in the same PR as code changes

3. **Documentation Organization**:
   - The [documentation index](./docs/documentation-index.md) is the master reference
   - Only documentation-index.md remains in the `/docs` root
   - All other documentation is organized in category folders

## Project Maintenance

### Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Run cleanup scripts before commits and releases
2. **Documentation First**: All features should be documented according to our [documentation guidelines](./docs/structure/documentation-guide.md)
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain high test coverage for all new and modified code
4. **Quarterly Review**: Perform documentation and code review quarterly to remove outdated content
5. **Automated Fixes**: Use the TypeScript auto-fixer (`pnpm run fix:typescript`) to resolve common errors
   - Enhanced TypeScript fixes: `pnpm run fix:typescript:enhanced`
   - React Query type fixes: `pnpm run fix:query-types:enhanced`
   - Test dependency fixes: `pnpm run fix:test-deps:enhanced`

## Implementation Patterns

The project implements several key patterns for robust, maintainable code:

- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Vitest and React Testing Library
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment with GitHub Actions
- **Form Validation**: Type-safe form validation with Zod and React Hook Form
- **API Abstraction**: Clean separation from Firebase implementation details
- **Error Handling**: Global error handling with Error Boundaries
- **Performance Monitoring**: Firebase Performance integration
- **Component Development**: Storybook for isolated component development
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with React Query
- **Network Connectivity**: Built-in network status detection with user alerts
- **Security**: Comprehensive Firestore security rules with role-based access

## Quick Start

See the [Project Setup Guide](./docs/setup/project-setup.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- pnpm v8+
- Firebase CLI

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Firebase credentials

# Start Firebase emulators
pnpm emulators

# Start development server (in a new terminal)
cd packages/hours
pnpm dev
```

### Development Workflow

For the most streamlined development experience, use our automated workflow:

```bash
# Start the automated workflow
pnpm run workflow

# Or use the shorthand
pnpm run dev
```

This will guide you through:
1. Branch creation/selection
2. Change management
3. Preview deployment
4. PR creation
5. Post-PR guidance

See [Automated Workflow Guide](./docs/workflow/automated-workflow-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

### Preview Deployments

Create Firebase preview deployments to test your changes:

```bash
# Create a preview deployment
pnpm run preview

# Create a preview and automatically create a PR
pnpm run preview-and-pr

# Quick preview with fewer checks
pnpm run preview --skip-lint --skip-tests
```

**Available Options:**
```
Quality Checks:
  --quick               Skip all checks (linting, type checking, tests)
  --skip-lint           Skip linting checks
  --skip-typecheck      Skip TypeScript type checking
  --skip-tests          Skip running tests
  --skip-build          Skip building the application

Fixing Options:
  --auto-fix-typescript Auto-fix TypeScript errors when possible
  --fix-query-types     Fix React Query type imports
  --fix-test-deps       Fix test dependencies and JSX runtime
  --dry-run             Preview changes without applying them

Deployment Options:
  --skip-deploy         Skip deployment (only run checks)
  --skip-cleanup        Skip cleaning up old preview channels

Logging Options:
  --save-logs           Save console output to log file
  --verbose             Enable verbose logging
```

### Channel Management

Manage your Firebase preview channels with these commands:

```bash
# View all active previews in a dashboard
pnpm run channels

# List channels in JSON format
pnpm run channels:list

# Clean up old previews (interactive)
pnpm run channels:cleanup

# Auto-clean old previews
pnpm run channels:cleanup:auto
```

### Production Deployment

After your PR is merged to main:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Deploy to production
node scripts/deploy.js "Your deployment message"
```

For detailed instructions, see [Firebase Deployment Workflow](./docs/workflow/firebase-deployment-workflow.md).

## Recent Improvements

1. **Eliminated Double Build**: Preview deployments now avoid rebuilding the application during deployment using the `skipBuild` parameter.

2. **Enhanced Post-PR Guidance**: Clear instructions for deploying to production after a PR is merged.

3. **Standardized Logger Usage**: Replaced direct console statements with a consistent logger API.

4. **Fixed Linter Issues**: Removed unused variables and improved code quality throughout the codebase.
